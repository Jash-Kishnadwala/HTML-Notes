### **Lecture 1: Introduction to HTML (Tags, Attributes & Backgrounds)**  

### ** Step 1: Introduction to HTML** (5-7 mins)  
**Q: What is HTML?**  
- HTML stands for **HyperText Markup Language**.  
- It is the **building block** of all websites.  
- **Analogy:** Think of HTML as the skeleton of a webpage—just like a human body needs bones to stand, a webpage needs HTML for structure.  

**Example:** Show a basic HTML structure  

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My First Webpage</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
    <p>This is my first webpage using HTML.</p>
</body>
</html>

 **Ask Students:**  
- What do you observe in this code?  
- Can you guess what `<h1>` and `<p>` are doing?

### Step 2: HTML Tags** (10 mins)  
**Q: What are Tags?**  
- HTML **tags** define elements on a webpage.  
- They always start with `<tag>` and end with `</tag>` (except self-closing tags).  

 **Types of Tags**  
1️ **Container Tags:** Have an opening and closing tag (`<h1>...</h1>`, `<p>...</p>`)  
2️ **Empty/Self-Closing Tags:** Don't have a closing tag (`<br>`, `<img>`).  

 **Example:**  

<h1>This is a Heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Image Example">

**Ask Students:**  
- What is the difference between `<h1>` and `<p>`?  
- What happens if we remove the closing tag?

###  Step 3: HTML Attributes** (10 mins)  
**Q: What are Attributes?**  
- Attributes provide **extra information** about an HTML element.  
- They are **always inside the opening tag**.  

**Common Attributes:**  
1️ `href` → Defines a link  
2 `src` → Defines an image source  
3️ `alt` → Provides alternative text for images  
4️ `style` → Adds inline CSS  

**Example:**  

<a href="https://www.google.com">Visit Google</a>
<img src="logo.png" alt="Company Logo">
<p style="color: blue;">This is blue text.</p>

**Ask Students:**  
- What do you think `href` is doing here?  
- Why is the image using an `alt` attribute?

### Step 4: Backgrounds in HTML** (10 mins)  
**Q: How can we change the background color of a webpage?**  
1️ **Using the `bgcolor` Attribute (Old Method)**  

<body bgcolor="yellow">
    <h1>Welcome</h1>
</body>

2️ **Using the `background` Attribute (For Images) (Old Method)**  

<body background="bg.jpg">
    <h1>Welcome</h1>
</body>

3️ **Using CSS (Recommended Modern Method)**  
<body style="background-color: lightblue;">
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
</body>

**Ask Students:**  
- What is the difference between using an image and a color as a background?  
- Why do you think we prefer the CSS method today?
